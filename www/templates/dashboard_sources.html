<h3>Notification Sources</h3>
Sources are notification senders. They are generally websites or web apps, but they can also be people. Anybody with a notify.io account can be a source. This page lets you manage your sources, allowing or disallowing their ability to send notifications and eventually being able to filter their notifications in various ways.
